README
    This is a guide to build TA using the ant tool. This document assumes you have already setup perforce workspace and checked-out TA project.

    Requirements:
      For building the entire project from scratch you will need Groovy, Grails 1.0.3 and Flex 3.x on your machine.
      Grails is required only if you are building the buildtools.jar.

    Environment:
      To build TA, firstly you need to checkout the 'Tumri build', 'Tumri install' and 'tas buildtools' from the perforce depot.
      These folders are available in perforce at the following locations:
      1. Tumri build - //depot/Tumri/build
      2. Tumri install - //depot/Tumri/install
      3. tas buildtools - //depot/Tumri/tas/buildtools

      The 'Tumri build' folder contains ant built scripts to build each project under the Tumri tree.
      'Tumri install' folder contains groovy scripts for installation.

      'tas buildtools' helps in building TA. Buildtools should be packaged to buildtools.jar and kept under 'dist' folder inside 'tas buildtools'.
      To build it, cd to buidtools folder and run 'ant -f build/build.xml build'

      You also need to set FLEX_HOME environment variable in-order to successfully build TA.
      If Flex is not available in your machine, download open source version of Flex 3 from Perforce depot at
      //depot/Tumri/tas/ext/flex/flex_sdk_3.6.0.16995A.zip and set FLEX_HOME.

    Build:
      Once the environment is setup, cd to the Tumri folder in your workspace

      Use the following commands:
      1. ant -f build/build.xml -p        --> Lists all avaialable build options
      2. ant -f build/build.xml configure --> Creates buildconf.properties, which can be edited for configuring the build
      3. ant -f build/build.xml build-ta  --> Builds ta
